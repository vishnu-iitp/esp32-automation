# ESP32 Code Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Device Status Fetching on Startup**
- **Problem**: ESP32 was not fetching existing device states from Supabase on startup
- **Solution**: Added `loadExistingDevices()` function that makes an HTTP GET request to Supabase REST API to fetch all devices and their current states
- **Implementation**: Uses WiFiClientSecure to connect to Supabase and parse JSON response

### 2. **Device Control Not Working**
- **Problem**: ESP32 was not responding to device state changes from the website
- **Solution**: Simplified and fixed the WebSocket message parsing to match the working code structure
- **Key Fix**: Used `doc["payload"]["data"]["record"]` path for parsing device updates (matching your working code)

### 3. **Add Device Feature Support**
- **Problem**: Code was overly complex and not handling INSERT events properly
- **Solution**: Streamlined the subscription and message handling while maintaining support for both INSERT and UPDATE events
- **Implementation**: Both new device additions and state changes now use the same `applyDeviceState()` helper function

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Simplified WebSocket Message Handling**
```cpp
void handleWebSocketMessage(uint8_t * payload, size_t length) {
    DynamicJsonDocument doc(1024);
    deserializeJson(doc, payload, length);

    String event = doc["event"];
    
    if (event == "phx_reply") {
        // Handle subscription confirmation
    } else if (event == "postgres_changes") {
        // Use the working JSON parsing path
        JsonObject data = doc["payload"]["data"]["record"];
        
        int gpio = data["gpio"];
        int state = data["state"];
        const char* deviceName = data["name"];
        
        applyDeviceState(gpio, state, deviceName);
    }
}
```

### 2. **Added Robust Device State Fetching**
```cpp
void loadExistingDevices() {
    // Makes HTTP GET request to /rest/v1/devices
    // Parses JSON response and applies all device states
    // Sets deviceStatesLoaded flag to prevent duplicate loading
}
```

### 3. **Created Helper Function for Device State Application**
```cpp
void applyDeviceState(int gpio, int state, const char* deviceName) {
    // Initializes GPIO if needed
    // Sets digitalWrite based on state
    // Provides clear logging
}
```

### 4. **Added State Tracking**
- Added `deviceStatesLoaded` flag to prevent duplicate device loading
- Added `initializedPins[]` array to track which GPIO pins have been configured

## How It Works Now

1. **Startup Sequence**:
   - ESP32 connects to WiFi
   - Establishes WebSocket connection to Supabase
   - Subscribes to device table changes
   - Fetches existing device states via HTTP REST API
   - Applies all existing device states to GPIO pins

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Receives WebSocket messages for device state changes
   - Parses using the working JSON structure
   - Applies state changes to appropriate GPIO pins
   - Supports both UPDATE (state changes) and INSERT (new devices) events

3. **Device Control Flow**:
   - Website updates device state in Supabase
   - Supabase sends WebSocket notification
   - ESP32 receives and parses the message
   - ESP32 applies the state change to the GPIO pin
   - Physical device (relay/light) responds

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] ESP32 boots and connects to WiFi
- [ ] WebSocket connection established
- [ ] Existing device states loaded on startup
- [ ] Devices that were ON remain ON after restart
- [ ] Real-time control from website works
- [ ] New device addition works
- [ ] Serial monitor shows clear logging

## Libraries Required

Make sure these libraries are installed in your Arduino IDE:
- `WiFi` (ESP32 core)
- `ArduinoJson` (by Benoit Blanchon)
- `WebSocketsClient` (by Markus Sattler)
- `WiFiClientSecure` (ESP32 core)
