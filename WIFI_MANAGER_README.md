# Modern WiFi Manager for ESP32 Home Automation

## Overview

This project now includes a modern, user-friendly WiFi Manager that replaces hardcoded WiFi credentials with a captive portal configuration system. The interface is designed to be sleek and professional while maintaining security by not revealing device information.

## Features

### üåê Modern Captive Portal
- **Sleek Design**: Modern gradient UI with smooth animations
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on phones, tablets, and computers
- **No Device Information Leakage**: Clean interface that doesn't reveal technical details
- **Professional Branding**: "Welcome to Your Smart Home" messaging

### üì∂ WiFi Management
- **Network Scanning**: Automatically discovers available WiFi networks
- **Signal Strength Indicators**: Visual signal strength display
- **Security Status**: Shows whether networks are open or secured
- **Connection Testing**: Tests credentials before saving
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Remembers and auto-connects to saved networks

### üîÑ Firmware Updates
- **Over-the-Air Updates**: Upload new firmware through the web interface
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress indication
- **Secure Updates**: Built-in validation and safety checks
- **User-Friendly**: Simple drag-and-drop interface

### üîß Reset Functionality
- **Hardware Reset**: Hold the BOOT button (GPIO 0) for 5 seconds to reset WiFi settings
- **Clean Reset**: Completely clears saved credentials and restarts config mode

## How It Works

### First Time Setup
1. **Power On**: When the ESP32 starts without saved WiFi credentials
2. **Access Point Mode**: Creates a hotspot named "SmartHome-Setup"
3. **Captive Portal**: Automatically redirects to configuration page
4. **Network Selection**: Scan and select your WiFi network
5. **Connect**: Enter password and connect
6. **Auto-Save**: Credentials are saved and device restarts in normal mode

### Normal Operation
- **Auto-Connect**: Automatically connects to saved WiFi on startup
- **Fallback**: If connection fails, automatically enters config mode
- **Timeout**: Config mode automatically times out after 5 minutes for security

### Resetting WiFi Settings
1. **Hold BOOT Button**: Press and hold the BOOT button (GPIO 0) for 5 seconds
2. **Confirmation**: Device will show reset confirmation in serial monitor
3. **Restart**: Device restarts and enters config mode

## Technical Details

### Files Added
- `WiFiManager.h` - Header file with class declaration
- `WiFiManager.cpp` - Implementation with captive portal logic

### Configuration
- **Access Point SSID**: `SmartHome-Setup`
- **Access Point Password**: None (open network for easier access)
- **Access Point IP**: `192.168.4.1`
- **Config Timeout**: 5 minutes
- **Reset Button**: GPIO 0 (BOOT button)

### EEPROM Usage
- **Address 100-131**: WiFi SSID storage (32 bytes)
- **Address 200-263**: WiFi Password storage (64 bytes)
- **Address 300**: Configuration flag (1 byte)

### Security Features
- **No Information Leakage**: Interface doesn't reveal device type, MAC address, or technical details
- **Timeout Protection**: Automatically exits config mode after 5 minutes
- **Credential Testing**: Tests WiFi connection before saving credentials
- **Secure Storage**: Credentials stored in EEPROM with proper bounds checking

## Usage Instructions

### Connecting to WiFi for the First Time

1. **Power on your ESP32 device**
2. **Look for WiFi network**: Search for "SmartHome-Setup" in your phone/computer WiFi settings
3. **Connect**: Join the network (no password required)
4. **Automatic Redirect**: Your browser should automatically open the setup page
5. **Manual Access**: If not redirected, go to `http://192.168.4.1`
6. **Select Network**: Click on your WiFi network from the scanned list
7. **Enter Password**: Type your WiFi password
8. **Connect**: Click "Connect to WiFi"
9. **Wait for Restart**: Device will restart and connect to your WiFi

### Updating Firmware

1. **Access Update Page**: Click "Update Firmware" on the main config page
2. **Select File**: Choose your `.bin` firmware file
3. **Upload**: Click "Upload Firmware" and wait for completion
4. **Automatic Restart**: Device restarts with new firmware

### Resetting WiFi Settings

**Method 1: Hardware Reset**
- Hold the BOOT button for 5 seconds until you see reset confirmation

**Method 2: Software Reset** (for developers)
```cpp
wifiManager.resetWiFiSettings();
```

## Integration with Existing Code

The WiFi Manager integrates seamlessly with your existing ESP32 home automation code:

- **Automatic Integration**: Simply include the header and initialize
- **Non-Blocking**: Doesn't interfere with normal device operation
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality remains unchanged
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses minimal additional resources

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect to SmartHome-Setup
- Ensure ESP32 is powered on and in config mode
- Check if your device supports 2.4GHz WiFi (5GHz not supported)
- Try restarting the ESP32

### Configuration Page Doesn't Load
- Manually navigate to `http://192.168.4.1`
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Ensure you're connected to the SmartHome-Setup network

### WiFi Connection Fails
- Double-check your WiFi password
- Ensure your network uses 2.4GHz (not 5GHz only)
- Check if your network has MAC address filtering enabled
- Try moving closer to your router

### Need to Reset
- Hold BOOT button for 5 seconds
- Check serial monitor for confirmation messages
- Device should restart automatically

## Development Notes

### Customization
- Modify the HTML/CSS in `getModernHTML()` to change appearance
- Adjust timeout values in the header file
- Change Access Point name by modifying `AP_SSID`

### Adding Features
- Extend the `ModernWiFiManager` class for additional functionality
- Add new web routes in the `startConfigMode()` function
- Implement additional security features as needed

### Dependencies
- ESP32 Arduino Core
- WebServer library
- DNSServer library
- EEPROM library
- Update library (for firmware updates)

This modern WiFi Manager provides a professional, secure, and user-friendly way to configure your ESP32 devices without revealing technical information or requiring users to manually edit code.
